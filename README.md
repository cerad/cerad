### Tagging hints

Need to make any tag related changes before creating the tag.  A tag is basically a short cut to a given commit.
After tagging you will probably need to undo any tag specific changes.

Use netbeans to create tag.  Remote push select tag to get it to github.  
As soon as you make another commit on the master branch the tag will no longer highlite in the repository browser.

git clone https://github.com/cerad/aysos5games.git aysos5games201306v
cd aysos5games201306v
git tag
git checkout v1.2013.06
