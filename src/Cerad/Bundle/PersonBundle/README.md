Cerad Person Bundle
=================

Tracks people along with their certification and registrations.

At the moment, person.id is a 32 bit guid.  (Well sort of).  

Want to leave open the possibility that the person information can be stored in a master database shared across multiple sites.

Might end up being more trouble than it is worth but in 
theory the only time the guids should be a problem is if you are writing manual queries.
