1. Get works good, store cookies in wordpress session

2. Post works for search form as well as login form

3. How to logout?  
   Made a wordpress logout page which kicks off /signout
   Seems to work okay

   Can we make it a post and then redirect?  
   Need some sort of button that kicks off an action?
   Also want to make logout/login based on the user's zayso status
